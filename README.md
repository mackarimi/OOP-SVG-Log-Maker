## Usage
As a coding boot camp student, I want a JavaScript fundamentals timed quiz with high marks to compare my progress to my peers.
Given my code test, I'm asked a question and a timer starts when I press start. After answering a question, I get another. Time is deducted when I answer a question incorrectly. I can save my initials and score when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
