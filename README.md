# OOPc_SVG_Logo_Maker

## Description

The Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker is about making a command-line program that lets users make a simple logo for their projects. The application lets users enter text, text color, shape, and shape color. Based on the input, an SVG file named "logo.svg" is made..

## Installation

Simply download or clone the directory, Start by cloning the project's repository from GitHub. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:git clone https://github.com/mackarimi/OOP-SVG-Log-Maker.git

## Usage

For the "Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker" project, I would need more information or the project's documentation to tell you how to use it. But, based on how most people use object-oriented SVG logo makers, I can give you a general idea of how you might use one:

Installing: Make sure you have the right programming languages and libraries installed in order for the SVG logo maker to work. Check the project's documentation or README file for detailed instructions on how to install it, including any requirements or dependencies.

Importing the module or classes: If the SVG logo maker is given as a module or classes, you will need to import them into your code. Depending on the programming language and how the project is set up, you may need to use an import statement or include the necessary files.

Creating a logo object: When using an object-oriented approach, you usually create a working copy of a logo class. This logo class might have properties and methods for working with SVG logos and making new ones. The project's documentation will tell you how to make a logo object.

Setting logo properties: Once you have a logo object, you can change its properties to change how the logo looks. Some of these properties could be colors, shapes, text, sizes, and so on. Learn how to set these properties correctly by reading the project's documentation.

Manipulating the logo: You can add shapes, text, effects, transformations, and other changes to the logo by using the methods that the logo object provides. Check out the project's documentation or class methods to learn about the manipulations you can use and how to use them well.

Making the SVG logo: After setting the properties and making the changes you want, you can use a certain method or function to make the SVG version of the logo. This method could either directly output the SVG code or save it to a file. Find out how to make the SVG logo by looking at the project's documentation or method details.

Customizing and repeating: You can set properties, change the logo, and make SVG output over and over again to make different versions of the logo. Try out different settings, effects, and other options to get the results you want. Iterate and make changes as needed to improve the look of the logo.

## Contribution

If you'd like to help with the "Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker," you can do so in a few different ways:

Fixing bugs: Look at the SVG Logo Maker project's codebase and the problems that are already there. Look for bugs or errors that have been reported and try to fix the code to fix them. You can send a pull request with your fixes and a detailed explanation of the bug and how you fixed it.

Find ways that the SVG Logo Maker could be improved or made bigger. This could mean adding new features, improving existing ones, or making the codebase as efficient as possible. Talk to the people in charge of the project about your ideas, or create an issue to suggest your improvements. Once you have a plan, implement the changes and send in a pull request.

Documentation: Every open-source project needs good documentation. You can help by improving the documentation that is already there or making new documentation where it is needed. This means updating README files, giving examples of how to use them, documenting classes and methods, and adding explanations for ideas or design choices.

Testing: Write new test cases or add to existing ones to help improve the project's test suite. Test the SVG Logo Maker carefully to make sure it is stable and reliable. You can also help by setting up continuous integration (CI) workflows to automate testing and make sure that changes in the future don't cause regressions.

Code refactoring: Look over the codebase and find places where the code can be changed to make it easier to read, maintain, or run faster. Refactoring can involve changing the way code is written, getting rid of duplicate code, using design patterns, or making algorithms run faster. Send a pull request with your updated code and a clear description of the changes you made.

Improvements to the user interface and user experience: If the SVG Logo Maker has a user interface, you can help by making it better or making the user experience better. This could mean redesigning the interface, adding features that are easy to use, or making it easier to figure out how to use. Coordinate your changes with the people who are in charge of the project and ask for feedback to make sure your changes fit with the project's goals.

## Test

Import the necessary modules and classes: To start the test file, import any modules or classes needed to test the shape-related functionality of the SVG Logo Maker.

Write test cases: Usually, you'll define multiple test cases in the test file to cover different parts of the shape functionality. Each test case focuses on a certain behavior or feature and checks if the expected output matches the actual output.

Case 1: Make sure that a shape object was made.
Test case 2: Find out where a shape object is.
Case 3: Check the shape object's size and dimensions.
Case 4: Check a shape object's color and style.
Test case 5: See if a shape object can be changed.
For each test case, you will define a function or a block of code that sets up the necessary conditions, performs operations on the shape objects, and verifies the expected results using assertions or testing frameworks.

Run tests and check results: After defining the test cases, you can run the tests with a testing framework or a test runner. The test cases will be run by the testing framework, which will then report the results. It will say which tests passed, which ones failed, and if there were any errors during the testing.

Look at the test results: Look at the test results to see if there were any failures or mistakes. Tests that didn't pass show that the SVG Logo Maker might have problems with how it works with shapes. Review the failed tests and find out why they failed so that any bugs or strange behavior can be fixed.

## Credits

Special thanks to :
The credits you listed are for resources and tools that can help you work with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and may have been helpful in making the Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker. Here is a quick summary of each credit:

The SVG Tutorial on Mozilla Developer Network (MDN): The Mozilla Developer Network has a lot of information about SVG and other web technologies. The SVG Tutorial on MDN is a complete guide to understanding and using SVG. It talks about basic shapes, paths, transformations, and more.

MDN's SVG Tutorial: Basic Shapes: This page of the MDN SVG Tutorial is all about how to make and use simple shapes like rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, and polygons. It gives examples and explanations of the ideas to help developers understand them and use them in their projects.

Visual Studio Code Extension - SVG: The mentioned Visual Studio Code extension is probably a tool that makes working with SVG files in the popular code editor easier for developers. It might have features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and previews that make it easier to create and edit SVG code.
